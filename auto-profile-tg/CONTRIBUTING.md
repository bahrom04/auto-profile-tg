# 🤝 Contributing to AutoProfile

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow these simple rules to keep the code clean, readable, and maintainable.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Branching

- All changes must be made on the `dev` branch.
  **Do not open PRs directly to `master`.**

---

## 🧼 Code Standards

- **Use clear comments** and **docstrings** in Python files.
  (Brief, relevant, and in English.)

- **Format your code** before pushing:
  We use `black` for formatting.

  ```bash
  black .
  ```

- Keep code **simple, clean, and readable**.

---

## 📦 Pull Requests

- Open PRs **against `dev` only**.
- Use clear PR titles and descriptions:

  - What was added?
  - Why was it added?
  - How does it work?

✅ Good example:

```
Add prayer time caching to reduce API calls
```

🚫 Bad example:

```
fix
```

## ✅ Checklist Before Pushing
